<!-- This is the content view of the tabs. It contains the editor
    With so many libraries for JS there is only one option of importing css i.e. to combine them. 
    Its tricky, will look into it later.

<!-- For record, browserify of any kind of 'require('module')' is not working.
    I think its because the content loaded into the tabs is loaded as <webview> 
    Electron does not allows NodeJS access to <webview> (like iFrame) for safety.
    As the 'require' keyword is written in NodeJS it won't be accessible without it. -->
